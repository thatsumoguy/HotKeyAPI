# HotKeyApi
An API for use with creating HotKeys. It uses JSON files for easy readability and making it easier for end users to edit their own hotkey.

This API is currently only available for Windows, but in the future it will be portable.

This currently only handles command prompts, powershell, and launching applications/batch files. It will handle actions (such as volume up or down, screen brightness up or down) in the future.
